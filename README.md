A Python library I am writing for use in my own machine learning research.  Basic features at present:
 * Tight integration with the powerful Lasagne and Theano libraries for constructing and training neural networks
 * Flexible, callback-based reinforcement learning engine that interfaces with OpenAI Gym
 * Streamlined loading of CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets

Future plans:
 * Add framework for running experiments and logging/plotting results
 * Implement and test reinforcement learning algorithms
