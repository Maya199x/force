A Python library I am writing for use in my own machine learning research.  Basic features at present:
 * Integration with PyTorch for constructing and training neural networks
 * Reinforcement learning functionality built atop OpenAI Gym
 * An implementation of proximal policy optimization (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)
 * Streamlined loading of CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets
 * Works with Python 2 and Python 3

Future plans:
 * Add framework for running experiments and logging/plotting results
 * More RL algorithms
