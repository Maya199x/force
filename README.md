A library I am writing for use in my own machine learning research. Built on PyTorch and OpenAI Gym. Basic features at present:
 * Tools for running experiments and logging/plotting results
 * Train neural networks using supervised learning or reinforcement learning
 * Flexible callback system for inserting custom behavior without rewriting the core functionality
