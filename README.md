# Force
Force is a library for reinforcement learning research, built on TensorFlow and OpenAI Gym.
It is under active development.
Basic features at present:
 * Tools for running experiments and logging results
 * An implementation of the [proximal policy optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) algorithm
 * Flexible callback system for inserting custom behavior without rewriting the core functionality

The name "Force" was originally derived from the word *reinforcement*, but, by a fun coincidence, it is also related to [one of my advisors](https://ai.stanford.edu/~tengyuma/) via [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton's_second_law).
